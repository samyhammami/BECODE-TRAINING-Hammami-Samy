# How does the internet works ?
## What's internet ?
Internet is a wire build under the ground. Thanks to this wire, you are able to **connect** 2 computers. Web pages are in fact files on the hard drive of a computer. Each server has its own **IP address** (can be compared as postal address) and this why they are able to communicate with each other.
## Differences between servers and computers : 

| Servers  | Computers (client) |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| Directly connected to internet  |connected through an internet provider (such as Proximus) |
 
## IRL example :
 
 If you want to send an email it will first go through your server (ex : outlook) and then send to the server's colleague (ex: Gmail)

## What's a router ?

When you send a message, internet will break it into packets and send it to the receiver. This is where the router will have its role. It will send the correct packets to the correct IP address !
