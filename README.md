# Samy Hammami => *Future Web Dev*

#### Who am I ?

I'm a brand new web dev student at Becode. I worked previously as a community manager at Orange Belgium 
And after almost 2 years I joined Uber Eats as a COR for a couple of months. I decided to get deep into the web dev world and learn about it.

### Web dev goal in Becode and fears ?
Understand the path of creating a website. Being able to create any type of website with all the existing features and requirements. I want to learn about my colleagues, their knowledge and give a hand when needed. 
> Everyone you will ever meet knows something you don't.

I think we all have the fear of failing and scared of not being able to do something. As far as I'm concerned life is a big experience where you will fail at some point. So I won't say I have no fears but I'm the type of guy who will put into perspective.
> Feel the fear and do it anyway.

### After rain, Good weather !
After this training I would like to specialize myself and start a career as a web developer. My ultimate goal is to work abroad and I think this training will give the takeaways needed for my dream. Hopefully I will work for myself but let's see what the future brings me.
> The **Future** depends on what we do in the **Present**.

### Strength in numbers !
- Respect
- Humility
- Open (Open-minded,listen to others)
